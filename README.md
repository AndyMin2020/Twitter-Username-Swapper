Use this at your own descretion. I've only used this on test accounts and nothing high-end. Although, it should get the job done.<br>

If you need helping swapping or cannot get this **simple** program working. Feel free to contact me.<br>

Install the required packages:<br>
* pip install requests<br><br>

The headers must include "x-csrf-token:" and "authorization: Bearer" so make sure you grab the correct one.<br><br>

Sign into the accounts you want to use, and head over to: 
1) Place the headers of the username that is being released in **"account1.txt"**<br>
2) Place the headers of the username that is claiming the username in **"account2.txt"**<br><br>

3) To run the program, open CMD in the directory and type "python main.py"

4) Follow the instructions and it'll complete the swap.
